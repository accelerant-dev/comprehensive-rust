This is an extension to the Unsafe Rust session that's part of the Rust Fundametals. 
That section discusses its mechanics. This section provides a more thorough understanding
of how to work with `unsafe` and produce your own. 

What you'll learn:

- what the terms undefined behavior, soundness and safety mean
- why the `unsafe` keyword exists in the Rust language
- how to write your own code using `unsafe` safely
- how to review `unsafe` code

introduction to `unsafe`

Much of the what we'll cover will be to provide a mental model.

 That is, we're attempting
developing a language-agnostic 

It can also be used as a standalone course to teach software engineers how 
to review unsafe code, with a particular focus on making it clear that ther
