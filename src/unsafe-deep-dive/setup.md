# Setting Up

You should have a Rust compiler installed that supports the 2024 edition of the
language, which is any version of rustc higher than 1.84.

```bash
$ rustc --version 
rustc 1.87
```

<!--

  tim: Adding this for later while I'm here.
  tim: We should be able to avoid this by just relying on the `cc` crate

We recommend that you install the [Bazel build system](https://bazel.build/install).
This will allow you to easily compile project that combine multiple languages.
