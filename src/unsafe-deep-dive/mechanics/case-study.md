# Case Study: Lesser-known parts of std::mem

As a group, we'll study some parts of Rust's memory management functionality:

- `std::mem::TransmuteFrom` trait and its `Assume` struct
- `std::mem::discriminant`
- `std::mem::forget_unsized`
- `std::mem::MaybeUninit<T>`

Split learners into small groups. After a few minutes, they should be able to
answer the following questions:

- What does it do?
- How does the documentation describe the safety contract, if any? Can that
  documentation be improved?
-
