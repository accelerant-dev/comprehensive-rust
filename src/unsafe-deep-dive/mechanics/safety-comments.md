# Safety comments

// TODO: Expand

<details>

An effective safety comment is falsifiable. That is, there should be something
empirical that people can point to and check.

Note that Clippy's lint for safety comments does little more than check that the
string SAFETY: appears before the `unsafe` keyword. There is no further
validation.
