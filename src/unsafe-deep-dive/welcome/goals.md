# Goals

This course enables Rust programmers

- to write their first unsafe block with confidence
- to know when they should ask for further help

It is _not_ a canonical or authoritative reference on using Unsafe Rust.

<details>

Some intermediate milestones that will also be reached:

- Increase learners' familiarity with `unsafe`
- Teach the hazards of improper unsafe code
- Teach the terminology of the domain
- Provide a deeper understanding of Rust's guarantees
- Enable code authors to self-review simple cases
