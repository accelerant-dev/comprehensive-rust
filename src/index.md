This is a derivative of the open source course developed by the Android team at
Google.

It's being offered as a paid option with the explicit blessing of the
upstream team - the project lead Martin even suggested it. 

The material covers the full spectrum of Rust, from basic syntax to advanced
topics like generics and error handling.

The course is designed to be interactive! Please share your knowledge, and
perhaps a few frustrations along the way.

We hope to:

* Give you a comprehensive understanding of the Rust syntax and language.
* Enable you to modify existing programs and write new programs in Rust.
* Show you common Rust idioms.

<!-- The first 6 sessions are called the "Rust Fundamentals".

Building on this, you're invited to also explore the
[Concurrency](concurrency.md) add on, which covers both classical concurrency
(preemptively scheduling using threads and mutexes) and async/await
concurrency (cooperative multitasking using futures).


## Assumptions

The course assumes that you already know how to program. Rust is a statically-typed
language and we will sometimes make comparisons with C and C++ to better
explain or contrast the Rust approach.

If you know how to program in a dynamically-typed language such as Python or
JavaScript, then you will be able to follow along just fine too. -->

This is an example of a _speaker note_. We will use these to add additional
information to the slides. This could be key points which the instructor should
cover as well as answers to typical questions which come up in class.
