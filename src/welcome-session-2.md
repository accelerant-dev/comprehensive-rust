# Session 2

We'll be gaining more knowledge of Rust in this session. In particular, the
session covers working with compound data structures and some of the quirks of
how control flow works.

We'll also introduce working with full programs, using cargo and third-party dependencies.

This will enable us to write fuller programs that what we were able to dabble
with in the last session.

Please remind the students that:

* They should ask questions when they get them, don't save them to the end.
* The class is meant to be interactive and discussions are very much encouraged!
  * As an instructor, you should try to keep the discussions relevant, i.e.,
    keep the discussions related to how Rust does things vs some other language. 
    It can be hard to find the right balance, but err on the side of allowing 
    discussions since they engage people much more than one-way communication.
* The questions will likely mean that we talk about things ahead of the slides.
  * This is perfectly okay! Repetition is an important part of learning. Remember
    that the slides are just a support and you are free to skip them as you
    like.

The idea for the first day is to show _just enough_ of Rust to be able to speak
about the famous borrow checker.

The way Rust handles memory is a major feature and we should show students this
right away.
